#Bonus Path
 default_bonus_path_1:0 "Wilds of Middle-earth"
 default_bonus_path_1_desc:0 "Much of Middle-earth is wild, with traces of ruined cities and fortresses from earlier civilisations among the mountains, rivers, forests, hills, plains and marshes. Those living here have learnt to adapt."
 default_bonus_path_2:0 "Misty Mountains"
 default_bonus_path_2_desc:0 "Ever since The Misty Mountains were created by Dark Lord Melkor in the First Age, they have impeded passage across Middle-earth. Slowly, the mountains have become increasingly perilous and dangerous to travelers."
 default_bonus_path_3:0 "Natural Resources"
 default_bonus_path_3_desc:0 "The abundance of arable land and metal rich mountains throughout Middle-earth, give us unparalleled access to the resources we need to create weapons of war."
 default_bonus_path_4:0 "Fortresses, Castles and Strongholds"
 default_bonus_path_4_desc:0 "Millennia of warfare has resulted in the erection of numerous walls, towers and fortifications, designed to keep marauding armies at bay. The stonework required to develop such comprehensive structures is a testament to the master masons."
 default_bonus_path_5:0 "Great East Road"
 default_bonus_path_5_desc:0 "Middle-earth was once a hotbed of commerce and gossip. The Great East Road is one of many Dwarven roads that snaked through the countryside."
 default_bonus_path_6:0 "Legacy of the Builders"
 default_bonus_path_6_desc:0 "From Minas Tirith to Helm's Deep, Isengard to Barad-dûr, the world is full of great wonders we can learn from."
 default_bonus_path_7:0 "Unending Riches"
 default_bonus_path_7_desc:0 "From Minas Tirith to Helm's Deep, Isengard to Barad-dûr, the world is full of great wonders we can learn from."
 default_army_path_1:0 "Word of Mouth"
 default_army_path_1_desc:0 "From blacksmiths to traders, when our hill forts and rural settlements are threatened, all shall take up arms and stand united."
 default_army_path_2:0 "Adaptability"
 default_army_path_2_desc:0 "Our brave soldiers may be the fiercest the world has seen, but true humility comes in learning from our defeats. By adopting tactics we encounter on the battlefield, we may outdo any fighting force we meet."
 default_army_path_3:0 "Professional Soldiers"
 default_bonus_path_3_desc:0 "The evolution of a levied fighting force into a professional standing army, paid dividends in terms of quality and expectation. The salaried soldier was much less likely to baulk at orders, or flee from combat."
 default_army_path_4:0 "Good Reputation"
 default_army_path_4_desc:0 "Wealth has a habit of attracting a sizable mercenary interest. A routine standard of payment of these forces allows for prices to be negotiated in our favor."
 default_army_path_5:0 "Reactive Recruitment"
 default_army_path_5_desc:0 "The act of levying local men of fighting age can contribute significantly to the dazzling size of the warhosts raised."
 default_army_path_6:0 "Noble Warlords"
 default_army_path_6_desc:0 "The heritage of our people lives on in our practice of appointing the elite to lead our men. Those with so much invested into our nation are hard to sway with offers of gold or land."
