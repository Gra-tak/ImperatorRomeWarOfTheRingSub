-Citizens, freemen, slaves and tribesmen are now Upper tier, Middle tier, Lower tier and Tribals.
	-Citizens/Upper tier provide a bit of manpower, Middle Tier provide a bit of income, and Tribals provide twice as much manpower as in the base game
	-Tribals promote to lower tier, not middle tier (freemen)
	
-Assimilation and (most) conversion have been disabled

-If orc pops migrate to a non-orc realm, they will move back to an orc country within a year.
-If a province containing orcs is occupied by a non-orc country, the orcs will raise as units to fight the occupier (pops are removed, after the war surviving units can be turned back to pops at a loss)

-Colonisation only requires 5 pops

-As units are 10% of the size (100), attrition weight, upkeep, etc. has also been reduced (more or less) proportionally 

-A 5-year truce is automatically applied each year between elf realms and the realms of the elf-friend humans, or at least the humans who respect elves such as the Rohirrim, woodsmen, etc. The effect can be broken via a decision, "The old alliances are dead" - but it comes with consequences for the rest of the game in the form of internal unrest.

-A -200 opinion modifier is applied between the Melkor religion realms and the good realms (Dunedain, elves, dwarves, northmen, mirkwoodmen, etc.)

-The following culture groups can build roads right away:
			country_culture_group = edain_group
			country_culture_group = edain_mixed_group
			country_culture_group = dwarf_group
			country_culture_group = noldor_group
			country_culture_group = teleri_group
			country_culture_group = vanyar_group

-Sauron mechanics are driven via character interactions
	-To attempt to convert a ruler, right click on their portrait and take the convert decision
	-Converted rulers will take a decision to convert their nobles - some may not like it and lose loyalty, depending on religion/traits
	-When a country is 50% melkor religion among its pops, it will get a huge relations boost towards Mordor which may allow making them a subject

MAGIC:
	-Mostly driven through character interactions (right click on a caster's portrait)
	-Nazgul have a "fear aura" spell that can be cast on combat by right clicking on the nazgul's portrait and selecting the "fear aura" spell
	-Witch King and Sauron can cast Dark Wards on their capital, making it extreeeemely hard to conquer
	-Rest of magic is still very WIP - elves and Dunedain have no spells as of yet
