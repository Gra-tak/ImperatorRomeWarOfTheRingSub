 br_startup.1.desc:0 "Middle Earth is in turmoil, disastrous plagues and invasions have caused many great realms to fall. Ecthelion II, the twenty-fifth Ruling Steward of Gondor, has just died. He is succeeded by his son Denethor II, who believes Gondor's defeat by Sauron's forces of Mordor is inevitable. After returning to Mordor in TA 2951, Sauron has been preparing for his final war to dominate Middle-earth, breeding immense armies of Orcs and allying with the easily corrupted nations of Men to Mordor's south and east. The Corsairs of Umbar threaten to attack Gondor's southern coastal subjects, while Orc raids begin to trouble the borders of Rohan. The White Wizard Saruman has taken the fortress of Isengard (Angrenost) as his own, causing some to question his intentions."

 br_startup.2.desc:0 "The Free Peoples of Middle-earth rule over their declining kingdoms, divided and distrustful of each other. Sauron seeks to unite Middle-earth in it's worship of Melkor, breeding immense armies of Orcs and allying with nations of Men from the east and south. The Corsairs of Umbar grow in strength, threatening Gondor's southern coastal subjects, while Orc raids begin to trouble the borders of Rohan. The White Wizard Saruman has taken the fortress of Isengard (Angrenost) as his own, causing some to question his intentions."

 br_startup.3.desc:0 "Rhudaur is a wild and untamed land for the most part and one of the three splinter kingdoms of old Arnor. The Dúnedain never settled here in large numbers, and though they have ruled the hill tribes without major issues for centuries, now the small Dúnedain aristocracy looks to its fortresses to protect them as the hillmen grow restless, spurred on by dark agents out of Angmar. The Dúnedain of Rhudaur must cast aside their old emnities and rivalries with Arthedain and Cardolan if they are to have any hope of weathering this storm."
 br_startup.3.t:0 "Rhudaur."
 br_startup.4.desc:0 "Gondor, bulwark of the West, has lost much of its former glory. Sauron has returned to Mordor, and the wild men of the east and our ancestral enemy, Umbar, are preparing for war against us. The rule of the stewards is failing, and now the fiefs will only answer Gondor's call in moments of dire need, and certainly not join us in wars of conquest. Gondor's power is but a small fraction of what it once was, but the blood of numenor - and the memory of that sunken island empire's pride and dignity - endures in the people of Minas Tirith, and a determined ruler may yet be able to defeat the rising shadow."
 br_startup.4.t:0 "Gondor."
 br_startup.5.desc:0 "The cursed Dúnedain and Elves may have thought they defeated you in the War of the Last Alliance, but you can never truly die as long as the ring endures. Fueled by your hatred and desire for vengeance, you have begun to reconstitute your spirit. You are still vulnerable, but from the abandoned fortress of Amon Lanc you have gathered the Nazgûl to you and a small following. The forces that oppose you are yet too strong to meet head on, and returning to Mordor is impossible while Gondor stands watch at the gates to the Black Land. Vengeance and eternal hatred shall they have - the elves are now diminished, but the Dúnedain stand watch over Middle Earth in their stead. They must be removed. To this end you have sent the Witch King to the cold lands of Angmar to occupy the Northern Dúnedain while you plot to weaken and cause the downfall of the rest of your enemies - or attempt to turn them to your cause, if such a thing could be contrived..."
 br_startup.5.t:0 "Dol Guldur."
 br_startup.6.desc:0 "The northern realm of the elves was founded in the Second Age by Thranduil and his father Oropher, becoming the most enduring elven kingdom populated by Sindar and Nandor. Until TA 1100 the forest was called Greenwood the Great (S. Eryn Galen), but then the shadow of Dark Lord Sauron fell upon it and it became known as Mirkwood (S. Taur-nu-Fuin). Sauron shut himself up in the fortress of Dol Guldur on Amon Lanc, driving away the men and elves that had populated the southern regions of the forest. Now strange creatures wander through the darkened Mirkwood..."
 br_startup.6.t:0 "Eryn Galen."
 br_startup.7.desc:0 "Imladris was founded by Elrond Half-Elven, a descendant of the great kings of the Eldar and heroes of the Edain of the First Age. Imladris was founded in the year 1697 of the Second Age to be a Noldor outpost following the destruction of the Elvish realm of Eregion by the forces of Sauron. Imladris is located in the homonymous valley, created long ago by Vala Oromë to allow the Elves to cross the Misty Mountains during the Great Journey. After the fall of Angmar, Eriador saw a long period known as the 'watchful peace', but with Sauron having returned to Mordor, it is almost certain that his orcish servants will begin stirring again in the north as well. They say the time of the elves is over, but perhaps under a reinvigorated leadership, it need not be so?"
 br_startup.7.t:0 "Imladris"
 br_startup.8.desc:0 "Like those of the Mirkwood, the habitants of Lothlórien are predominantly Silvan elves. As a mysterious powerful evil called the Necromancer has taken up residence at Amon Lanc east of Anduin, the Wood Elves of the north led by Thranduil moved further north, and those of the south returned west beyond the Great River, without their last lord Amroth. The southern Wood Elves proclaimed Galadriel and Celeborn as their new lords, and went to live in the forest west of the river. Galadriel guards Lórien thanks to the power of her elven ring, Nenya."
 br_startup.8.t:0 "Lórien"
 br_startup.9.desc:0 "Lindon was the last remaining land of Beleriand after the War of Wrath at the end of the First Age, the rest of the lands had been destroyed or submerged during the clashes. In ancient times it was crossed by seven rivers, then it was broken in two by the course of the Lhûn and its gulf and its geography was partially changed in the upheavals due to the war between Morgoth and the Valar. Many of the Elves of Beleriand moved to Lindon in the early Second Age, where they were led by Gil-galad, the High King of the Noldor. Together they built Mithlond (the Gray Ports) in the Gulf, the main city, and many Elves departed from there for Valinor."
 br_startup.9.t:0 "Lindon"
 br_startup.10.desc:0 "Arthedain is one of the three splinter kingdoms of old Arnor, seat of the former High King of the Dúnedain, Elendil. Its rugged landscape, reminiscent of Númenor, and its proximity to the elves of Lindon meant that many of the wisest and most noble of the Númenórean elf-friends settled here, and that is still reflected today. Arthedain is a land of scholars, poets, mystics - and some of the best armies in Middle-Earth are trained here as well. The Dúnedain of this land have spent much of their strength in petty wars with Cardolan and Rhudaur, but now rumors spread like wildfire of a newly risen threat in the north - Angmar. Ruled by the mysterious 'Witch King', this champion of the Dark Lord is gathering all evil to him and Arthedain would do well to prepare a response."
 br_startup.10.t:0 "Arthedain."
 br_startup.11.desc:0 "One of the last remnants of the Dúnedain of Arnor, the Rangers of the North protect the wild lands of Eriador from the servants of Darkness. They are grim in appearance, usually dressed in grey or dark green, with a cloak-clasp shaped like a seven-pointed star. The rangers are known as 'Watchers' to the peoples of Bree and the Shire, where they are also considered dangerous and distrustful.\n\nUnder the leadership of their chieftains, the rangers have survived centuries of peril and most recently have begun to build a new nation in 'The Angle', a narrow strip of land protected by rivers to the east, south and west. Scattered ranger villages and outposts dot the north as well all the way up to the areas of the old capital, Fornost. The Dunedain of the north have long been operating in the shadows, but perhaps now it is time for the hidden people to reveal themselves and reclaim their destiny."

She is very hard to turn away, so finally you give in, curious as to where she has come from and what she is offering. As you are alone, she promises you great power over your enemies while hinting at immortality for you and your closest. The true lord of this world, she says, is named Melkor, and he will reward his most loyal servants when he returns. The emissary, having spoken of many dark secrets known only to the wisest - and hidden from most mortals - pauses to await your reaction. This is no errant fraudster, she is clearly a powerful priestess of some kind and you have seen her reveal some of her powers. What shall you do?"

For centuries you have guarded the north in secret while those you protect look upon you with distrust, considering you strange at best and dangerous at worst. Yet you are the heirs of Numenor and Arnor, the Kings of Men, and your ancestral right to rule these lands is not contested. If you come forth from the shadows, many will still remember the kings of old and how they fought tirelessly against the shadow. On the other hand, Sauron will also do what he can to stop you and his reach grows longer with each passing year. As Chieftain of the Dunedain it is your decision: Reveal yourself and organise the free people in defense of their homes, or stay hidden in the shadows - at least for a while longer."

Yet Sauron shows you another future as well, one in which you are his lieutenant, ruling the West in his name, guiding the race of men into the 4th Age, if only you would join him, willingly.

Once he is shown the certainty of his defeat, you offer him a choice. If he were to join you willingly, you may consider him as a trusted lieutenant to rule the lands west of the Misty Mountains, and he would be mighty King in his own right, though subservient to Mordor.
